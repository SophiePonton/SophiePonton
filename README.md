## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Sophie**, a passionate Computer and Systems Sciences student with a strong interest in **Cybersecurity**.

Studying Digital Design in high school led me to pursue a degree in UX design. However, Iâ€™ve always been drawn to technology and problem-solving, which lead to my discovery of Cybersecurity! For me, Cybersecurity is the perfect combination of creativity and analytical thinking, two things that have always been part of me.

Today Iâ€™m fully focused on building my expertise within Cybersecurity, which is reflected in my pursuit of a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science at Stockholm University.
